GCC/SIMD/ASM PERFORMANCE TESTS

Written by Larry Bank

The gcc_perf project is to test the CPU performance (float/int) on Intel+ARM
devices in 32-bit and 64-bit mode. The purpose is to see what the differences
can be attributed to the execution mode and what can be attributed to the
C compiler (GCC).

Running the tests:
------------------
If you run the test program with no parameters, it will run through
every function and test the performance on small and large buffers. The
numbers represent the time in milliseconds to run thousands of iterations
of each test.

A single numerical parameter will run a single test:
gcc_perf 2 will run test number 2. To get a list of what functions
are available use a parameter of -1. Here is sample output for
one of the functions:

Multiply Complex C (bigger than cache) = 5070ms
Multiply Complex SIMD (bigger than cache) = 2604ms
Multiply Complex ASM (bigger than cache) = 2554ms
